# ViewsAndModifiers
This is a basic learning technique project diving deep into SwiftUI's core concepts. It covers views and view modifiers in detail, learning key questions like why SwiftUI uses structs for views, the purpose of some View, and how modifiers work.
The source learning is from 3rd project of course "100 Days of SwiftUI" (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)
